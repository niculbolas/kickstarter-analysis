# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
This project deals with a large number of data for kickstarter fundraisers.  The goal here was to help an imaginary friend determine how they could best create various kickstarter campaigns that would end in success rather than fail or become canceled.

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The graph below shows the results of the kickstarter data for theaters campaigns broken down by the month that the campaign was launched and whether the campaign ended in success, failured, or was canceled.  From the graph, it is evident that the most successful month of the year to launch a theater kickstarter was in May and the least successful month was December.  It is also easy to see that the number of failed and canceled theater kickstarters does have some variability from month to month but those two remain much more consistent than the successes.  Thus, the reached conclusion is that the best month to start a theater kickstarter would be in May with each successive month lowering the chance of succes for the remainder of the year.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
From looking at the graph, it is evident that the most successful months for theater kickstarters is in the month of May and then there is a decline for the rest of the year.  On the other hand, the number of failed and canceled theater kickstarters remain fairly consistent.  There is of course some month to month variation, but it is not as pronounced as it is with the succeses.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
