# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
### Purpose
This project deals with a large number of data for kickstarter fundraisers.  The goal here was to help an imaginary friend determine how they could best create a kickstarter campaign that would end in success rather than fail or become canceled.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
From looking at the graph, it is evident that the most successful months for theater kickstarters is in the month of May and then there is a decline for the rest of the year.  On the other hand, the number of failed and canceled theater kickstarters remain fairly consistent.  There is of course some month to month variation, but it is not as pronounced as it is with the succeses.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
